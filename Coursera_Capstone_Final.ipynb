    "STEM education (where STEM stands for **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **M**athematics) is not new for developed countries where technical education is already a part of studying at schools. However, in developing countries like Ukraine where I am from, functions of STEM education still rare at regular schools and delivered as services by Technic clubs. So it is up to parents/kids whether he would attend such courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side such clubs themselves are commercial projects with profit as an aim. Though more and more clubs opening last years there is still great share of market of technical education for children to be covered. And the most lucrative is opening new Robotics club in Kyiv - the capital of Ukraine with more than 3 million people officially living there (real number much higher). \n",
    "\n",

    "Mistake in choosing the place in this case might cost existence of business and loss of large part of investment. Hence entrepreneur, planning to start this business, as the main stakeholder, should be desirable for support in this choice\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose best place for starting Robotics club we need to take into account many aspects. Most important of them are:\n",
    "- How to divide the city into neighborhoods (no such information readily available so decision must be taken)\n",
    "- Amount of schools in neighborhood (the more - the better)\n",
    "- Amount of rivals (technical / math courses for school children, the less - the better)\n",
    "- Amount of other not technical courses for same auditory (they might be interested in other education as well)\n",
    "- Cost of rent (requires some work to get some indirect markers of price from Foursquare while rent prices not available there)\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously exploring Foursquare data for the city would answer most of above questions (and with some enhancements described in data section - all of them) so let us move on to define what data can we collect and which way to use it."

    "I have found with some surprise that rivals (Technical education clubs) are presented on Foursquare not in an education related category but as an entertainment service. So I had to adopt my initial plan to build model not for rivals only expected but for overall entertainment services venues amount expected for this surrounding and than comparing it with actual. Then I would simply check all exact direct rivals locations and eliminate alternatives where rivals are less than 2 km away (distance on surface, actual via roads might be higher) from the alternative coordinates."
